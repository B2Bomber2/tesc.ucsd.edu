For example, if org A is allocated $1,500, they will need to submit for Event A funding for $800. If Event A follows funding guidelines, the proposal will be accepted, and TESC will fund that event for $800. If they want to fund Event B for another $800, TESC will fund up to $700 (if Event B is eligible) guaranteed.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <FinanceReq data={newReqs} />\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center w-100 mt-5\">Things to submit by <b className=\"finance__em\">Sunday, October 20 at 11:59 PM PST</b></h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Fill out this <a href=\"https://tesc.typeform.com/to/HLke9M\" target=\"_blank\">typeform</a>, to do so please have available the following:<br/>\n                        <i>Note that this typeform is comprehensive, and will take around an hour</i>\n                    </p>\n\n                    <ul className=\"px-5 finance__list\">\n                        <li>\n                            Budgets\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>2018-2019 (Final)</li>\n                                <li>2019-2020 (Prospective)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            Member List\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>2018-2019 (Final)</li>\n                                <li>2019-2020 (Prospective)</li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            Outreach events - general schedule per quarter as stated above\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n\n                    <p>\n                        After all organizations submit the required information, we will allocate a portion of TESC funds to each organization. <i>This does not mean we are writing you a check for that amount.</i> You will still need to submit funding requests each time you want funding (per event/project).
